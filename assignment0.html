<h3>Introduction About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Geethanjali Kakkera. I am graduate student at Bridewater State University in computer science department. I had worked on several projects which are associated to VLSI/electronics background in which I designed the break failure indicator circuit which continuously monitors the condition of brake and gives an audio and visual indication. I also worked on Fabrication of PCB and design circuit diagram of Military robot which focus on tracing and observing enemy activities. With this experience, I realized i should have strong knowledge in compueter science to build my career in Aurtificial intelligence and Machine learning. So i am currently pursuing master's program in computer science.</p>
